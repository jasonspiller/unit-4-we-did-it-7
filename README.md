WeDidIt7.com is the story of our WDI7 journey. It is a place to Share pictures, videos, stories, inside jokes, really anything that makes you happy about our time in WDI7.

There will be two major sections of the website, The Storyline and The Team.

The Storyline will display Shares posted by people that sign up. It will be sortable by Story Mode, Newest or Oldest. The Storyline will be accessible to the public.

The Team page will be a list of everyone that signs up for the site. There will be some basic information for each user. You will be able to click in to a full profile for that person. This section will only be available to people that are signed in.

The site will feature standard CRUD functionality for Shares and Users.
